# Plan to Build & Deploy the "Safety for Women Movement" Website for Free

This document outlines a strategy to develop and launch this comprehensive website with minimal to no financial cost, leveraging free tools and services available in the tech ecosystem.

## 1. Development Environment (Free)

*   **Code Editor:** Use **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. It is a powerful, free, and open-source code editor with excellent support for React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS through extensions.
*   **Version Control:** Use **Git** for tracking code changes. It's the industry standard and completely free.
*   **Code Repository:** Host your code on **GitHub**. They offer free public and private repositories, which is perfect for this project.

## 2. Front-End Application (Free)

The application is built with React and TypeScript. This is a static site, meaning it doesn't require a traditional server to run, which makes hosting very cheap or free.

*   **Dependencies:** This project uses the following libraries:
    *   `react` & `react-dom`: The core of the application.
    *   `react-router-dom`: For handling navigation within the single-page app (using `HashRouter`).
    *   `recharts`: For creating the beautiful and interactive charts on the "Our Impact" page.
    *   `tailwindcss`: For styling, loaded via a CDN script in `index.html`.

    These libraries are open-source and free to use.

## 3. "Backend" and Data Management (Free Options)

A traditional backend can be costly. For a project like this, we can use free "Backend-as-a-Service" (BaaS) or serverless solutions.

*   **Form Submissions (Pledge, Contact, Audits):**
    *   **Netlify Forms / Vercel Forms:** If you host on Netlify or Vercel, they have built-in form handling on their free tiers. You just add a special attribute to your HTML form, and they will collect submissions for you.
    *   **Tally.so / Google Forms:** Create forms on these platforms and embed them into the website. Submissions are collected in their dashboards.

*   **Data Storage (for audits, volunteers, etc.):**
    *   **Google Sheets as a Database:** You can use a Google Sheet as a simple, free database. The Google Sheets API allows you to read and write data programmatically. This is perfect for the street safety audit data, which could then be read to generate the heatmap.
    *   **Firebase / Supabase:** These platforms offer generous free tiers that include a database (Firestore/PostgreSQL), authentication, and storage. This is a more scalable long-term solution than Google Sheets.

## 4. Hosting & Deployment (Free)

Since this is a static React application, there are several excellent free hosting options.

*   **Vercel:** Optimized for modern frontend frameworks like React. Connect your GitHub repository, and Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site on every push. Free SSL, custom domains, and a global CDN are included. **(Highly Recommended)**
*   **Netlify:** Another fantastic option, very similar to Vercel. It also offers continuous deployment from GitHub, free SSL, and a generous free tier.
*   **GitHub Pages:** Host your site directly from your GitHub repository for free. It's slightly more complex to set up for a React app compared to Vercel/Netlify but is a solid choice.

**Deployment Steps (using Vercel):**
1.  Push your final code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Sign up for a free Vercel account using your GitHub account.
3.  Import your GitHub repository into Vercel.
4.  Vercel will automatically detect it's a React app and configure the build settings.
5.  Click "Deploy". Your site will be live on a `*.vercel.app` URL in minutes. You can later add a custom domain if you have one.

## 5. Additional Features (Free Tiers)

*   **Social Media Feed:**
    *   Use a service like **Curator.io** or **Juicer.io**. They have free plans that allow you to aggregate your social media posts into an embeddable widget for your website.

*   **Analytics:**
    *   **Google Analytics:** Add the free tracking script to your `index.html` to get detailed insights into your website traffic and user behavior.

By following this plan, the Safety for Women Movement can have a powerful, professional, and fully functional web presence without incurring hosting or software costs, allowing them to focus their resources on their core mission.
